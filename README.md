This dataset contains 1,130 images including 543 e-scooter rider instances and 587 other vulnerable road user instances, for the characterization of detection and classification model performance for partially occluded e-scooter riders. Vulnerable road user instances are occluded by a diverse mix of objects across a range of occlusion levels from 0 to 99% occluded.

Images are annotated using the objective occlusion level annotation method described in [“Pedestrian Occlusion Level Classification using Keypoint Detection and 2D Body Surface Area Estimation”](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/OVIS/papers/Gilroy_Pedestrian_Occlusion_Level_Classification_Using_Keypoint_Detection_and_2D_Body_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf) Gilroy _et al_ 2021.
